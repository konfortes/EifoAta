There are a couple of things you should do first, before you can use all of git's power. First, you'll want to add a remote to the project. From the Cloud9 IDE command line, you can execute the following commands:

git remote add [remote name] [remote url]
remote url is the location of the project on GitHub; for example 'git@github.com:/ajaxorg/node_chat'. You'll have to create a GitHub project first in order to generate this URL. Adding a remote URL lets you freely push and pull your project.

Next, create a few new files inside your project. By default, you should already have a README.md. You can add these files to git with the following command:

git add [file1, file2, file3, ...]
Finally, create a commit that you can push to your remote:

git commit -m 'added new files'
Don't forget to push this commit out to GitHub:

git push [remote name] master
